Minimalist IVLE
===============

A stylesheet mod that turns IVLE into something usable by removing clutter.

This stylesheet should only be used by students because it may hide or modify
functionality that staff or lecturers might use.

##Important Note
This project has been deprecated by recent changes in IVLE.

Apparently, the mode of installation was a security vulnerability that has since been fixed. Who would have known?

If you have previously installed the mod, you might be seeing some scary looking text on your profile right now. Not to worry, the original uninstallation steps still remove the mod cleanly.

While the project can no longer be used (or revived, due to technical reasons), we're keeping this repo live for posterity. Thanks for your support!
